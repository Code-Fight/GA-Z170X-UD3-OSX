# GA-Z170X-UD3 based hackintosh #
This repo contains all the files required for a hackintosh based on the Gigabyte GA-Z170X-UD3 motherboard.

I use the following hardware on my system:
* GA-Z170X-UD3
* Intel Core i5-6600k @ 4.4GHz
* EVGA 980TI SC+ ACX 2.0
* 16 GB Kingston HyperX Fury (2x8GB)
* Samsung 850 Evo 500GB
* Apple PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet (Intel 82574L based)

The guide can be found on [TonyMacX86](http://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-el-capitan-on-the-ga-z170x-ud3.180618) I prefer that questions are asked there and not in issues on this repo.
